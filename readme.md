## cross section volumes

Install OpenSCAD by visiting [their website](https://openscad.org/downloads.html), or `yay -S openscad`

OpenSCAD is not signed, so you'll have to right click on the application in finder then hit Open instead of just double-clicking.

And you need to install the python wrapper and the progress bar: `python3 -m pip install openpyscad tqdm`

Then, run the file and look on your desktop for `output.scad`
